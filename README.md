**Backend (Node.js & Express.js)**
* **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment.
* **Express.js:** A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
* **SQLite3:** A lightweight, file-based relational database.
* **CORS:** Middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
* **Nodemon:** A tool that helps develop Node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes are detected.

**Development Tools**
* **Vite:** A fast build tool for frontend development.
* **Concurrently:** A tool to run multiple commands concurrently (used to run both frontend and backend servers with one command).
* **Git:** Version control system.
* **GitHub:** For source code hosting and collaboration.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run Locally

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (LTS version recommended)
* npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/aglucazgeorgeann-ship-it/ecommerce-app-react-nodejs.git](https://github.com/aglucazgeorgeann-ship-it/ecommerce-app-react-nodejs.git)
    cd ecommerce-app-react-nodejs
    ```

2.  **Install Root Dependencies:**
    This will install `concurrently`.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Install Backend Dependencies:**
    Navigate to the `backend` folder and install its dependencies.
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    cd .. # Go back to the root directory
    ```

4.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**
    Navigate to the `frontend` folder and install its dependencies.
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    cd .. # Go back to the root directory
    ```

### Running the Application

After installing all dependencies, you can start both the backend and frontend servers with a single command from the root directory.

1.  **Start Both Servers Concurrently:**
    From the root directory (`ecommerce-app-react-nodejs/`), run:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This command uses `concurrently` to start the backend (on `http://localhost:3001`) and the frontend (usually on `http://localhost:5173/`, `5174/`, etc., check your terminal for the exact port).

2.  **Access the Application:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to the frontend URL displayed in your terminal (e.g., `http://localhost:5174/`).
